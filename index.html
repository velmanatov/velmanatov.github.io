    <p>Here you'll find some random projects that I am able to use github pages to demonstrate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="advent-of-code-2023-day-3/">My Advent of Code 2023 - Day 3 solution (a vue3 app using typescript)</a>
            (see <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3">https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3</a> if you want to know what it's all about)
             Code <a href="https://github.com/velmanatov/advent-of-code-2023/tree/main/day3/gear-ratios">is here on my github</a>.
